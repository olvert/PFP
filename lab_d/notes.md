## Notes

```stack build gtk --flag gtk:have-quartz-gtk```

"Repa does not support nested parallellism. This means that you cannot map a parallel worker function across an array and then call computeP to evaluate it, or pass a parallel worker to parallel reductions such as foldP. If you do then you will get a run-time warning and the code will run very slowly."
